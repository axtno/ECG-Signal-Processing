# Introduction
As humans age, blood pressure regulation and pulse rhythm continuously decline. 
This decrease in cardiovascular function can lead to many age-related conditions like Alzheimerâ€™s disease or dementia. 
The goal of this project is to analyze ECG signals from various age groups and determine a correlation between declining cardiac rhythm and age progression. 

## Assumptions
As analyzing every data file was not feasible given the time constraint, we picked a sample at random across five age groups: 18-19, 30-34, 45-49, 65-69, and 85-92 years.
We assumed that the trend would be consistent regardless of sex; however, we still differentiated between devices used for data acquisition.
